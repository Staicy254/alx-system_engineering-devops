0x06-regular_expressions
Study of Regular expressions (regex) are a special type of pattern used to search for and manipulate text. They use a combination of literal characters, special characters, and quantifiers to define a specific pattern.

Here are some key aspects of regular expressions:

Matching: Regular expressions match against a given text string to find specific patterns.
Syntax: They have a specific syntax with special characters like . (any single character), * (zero or more occurrences), + (one or more occurrences), ^ (beginning of string), $ (end of string), etc.
Case sensitivity: By default, regular expressions are case-sensitive, but you can use flags like i to make them case-insensitive.
Capturing groups: You can use parentheses to capture specific parts of the matched text for further processing.
