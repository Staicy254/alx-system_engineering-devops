Network Concepts:
1. OSI Model:

What it is: A conceptual framework for understanding network communication. It defines seven layers, each with specific functionalities involved in data transmission.
How many layers it has: Seven.
How it is organized: It follows a layered approach, where each layer provides services to the layer above it and relies on the services of the layer below.
2. LAN (Local Area Network):

Typical usage: Connecting devices within a close physical proximity, like a home, office, or school.
Typical geographical size: Covers a small area, usually less than a kilometer.
3. WAN (Wide Area Network):

Typical usage: Connecting geographically dispersed LANs over long distances.
Typical geographical size: Spans a large area, potentially covering entire countries or continents.
4. Internet:

A global system of interconnected computer networks that facilitates communication and resource sharing between devices worldwide.
5. IP Address:

A unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to an IP network, used for identification and location routing of data packets.
6. Types of IP Addresses:

IPv4: The original version, with limited address space due to its 32-bit format.
IPv6: The newer version, offering a significantly larger address space with its 128-bit format.
7. localhost:

A special hostname that refers to the device itself, used to access local services without needing its full IP address.
8. Subnet:

A logical division of a larger network into smaller broadcast domains, improving network efficiency and security.
9. IPv6:

Created to address the limitations of IPv4, primarily the exhaustion of available IP addresses due to the increasing number of internet-connected devices.
10. TCP/UDP:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): A reliable, connection-oriented protocol that guarantees data delivery in the correct order and error-free.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): A connectionless, best-effort protocol that prioritizes speed over reliability, making it suitable for real-time applications where order and error detection are less critical.
11. Port:

A logical channel associated with an IP address, used to differentiate between different services running on the same device.
12. Port Numbers:

SSH: 22 (secure shell)
HTTP: 80 (hypertext transfer protocol)
HTTPS: 443 (secure HTTP)
13. Network Connectivity Tool:

Ping: A simple tool used to test network connectivity by sending and receiving data packets to a specific IP address.
